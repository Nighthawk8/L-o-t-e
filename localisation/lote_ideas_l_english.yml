 CUM_confederation:0 "Spirit of Confederation"
 CUM_confederation_desc:0 "For most of our history, we have existed as a confederation of tribes, individual units working toward a common goal.

 CUM_foreign_nobility_desc:0 "Many Cumans from border tribes have opted to reside in neighboring countries.  Some of these immigrants have joined these nations' nobility, even royalty.  By cultivating our cultural kinship with these expatriates, we can further our diplomacy with the many nations they represent."

 CUM_cavalry_desc:0 "Few abilities matter more to a Cuman than skill with a horse.  Whether hunting for food or men, we who live on the Eurasian steppes live or die on horseback.  Our more 'civilized' neighbors are ill-prepared to face the cavalry of true steppe warriors!"

 CUM_discipline:0 "Mighty Warriors"

Many times have we annihilated the lesser forces of the Rus; under Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan, our kinsmen decisively destroyed an army of the Latin pretenders.

 CUM_codex_cumanicus:0 "Adapt the Codex Cumanicus"
 CUM_codex_cumanicus_desc:0 "Around a century ago, missionaries of Roman Christianity began writing the Codex Cumanicus, a manual designed to help them communicate with our people.

 QCH_cav_traditions:0 "Equestrian Traditions"
 QCH_cav_traditions_desc:0 "Our people may have forgotten our position on the steppes, but they have remembered the critical role our horses played in our survival.

 QCH_assimilation:0 "Uyghur Assimilation"
 QCH_assimilation_desc:0 "Few remember the Tocharians; we assimilated them after we migrated to the Tarim Basin.  The Sogdians too have willingly joined our way of life.

 QCH_tunnel_builders:0 "Tunnel Builders"
 QCH_tunnel_builders_desc:0 "We carved the Bezeklik Caves out of the Earth, impressive structures housing magnificent Buddhist murals.  Perhaps we could learn something from these constructions that would apply above ground as well?"

 remember_the_battle_of_montaperti: "The Battle of Montaperti"
 remember_the_battle_of_montaperti_desc: "On the 4th of September, 1260AD, the army of the Republic of Siena defeated the Florentines in a battle that, on paper, should have been won by the Florentines since they outnumbered the Sienese (~20,000 vs. ~33,000). Our miraculous victory over the devilish Florentines is something to be heralded for ages to come, as a badge and title of honor for the republic and a memory by which our military strives to uphold and honor throughout the generations."
 reform_monetary_practices: "Reform Monetary Practices"
 reform_monetary_practices_desc: "Our skills in handling money is no secret. Since our inception in the early 12th century, money handling has been key to how Siena thrives and prospers, thus making us ripe for financial collapses or mishaps. By reforming how we do such monetary transactions and deals, whether they are in the form of taxes or loans, we can ensure a great income and financial stability for the whole of Siena."
 alliances_and_rivals_of_italy: "Alliances and Rivalries in Italy"
 alliances_and_rivals_of_italy_desc: "The many powers in Italy know that alliances, marriages, and rivals all play a role in the constant power struggles that occur. It is no secret that all Italian states, no matter how small, wish for a more unified homeland, but that will only occur via bloodshed and unrepentant deals, so we must be the same and do what we can to ensure we are diplomatically on top."
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance: "Stave of Episcopal Dominance"
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance_desc: "The Papacy is a fine figure in Italy, contentious as it may be with the Papal States attempting to secure political authority on top of religious authority. Still, despite our proclamation as an independent republic, they seek to slowly bring the tide of episcopal dominance over us, over Siena as a whole. We must not allow this to happen, no matter the cost; the Republic of Siena must survive!"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans: "Against the Tuscans"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans_desc: "The Tuscans of Italy have always been our rivals and they know this all too well, like we do. We must do what we must to keep our administration clean of schemeing Tuscan merchants, diplomats, and agents so that we can proceed unhindered against them, politically and militarily."
 produce_grand_art: "Produce Grand Art"
 produce_grand_art_desc: "The crown jewel of the republic has to be the blooming industry of fine art. Magnificent paintings and painters produce works of unimaginable grandeur for the likes of royalty, nobility, and the clergy alike and when they make their rounds outside of Siena, they only bring our name further out to different realms, and our prestige, higher than ever before. Who wouldn't want a Sienese art piece, after all?"

 QRA_a_new_homeland_desc: "After the Jurchens forced us from our ancestral home, our founder Yelü Dashi fled west to establish a new nation.  In a matter of decades, we established a new empire through conquest.  Who says we should stop now?"
 QRA_muslim_subjects: "Muslim Subjects"
 QRA_muslim_subjects_desc: "Most of our subjects are Muslim, but we do not let this difference distract from their status as loyal subjects.  We have permitted our Muslim citizens to worship freely with no interference with local religious authority.  Were we to adapt this policy to other religions, our new subjects could continue their old methods of worship so long as they swear loyalty to our nation."
 QRA_liao_legacy: "Liao Legacy"
 QRA_liao_legacy_desc: "Our nation was born from the Khitan Liao dynasty that ruled an empire across the steppes of northern China and Mongolia.  The Jurchens may have sent the Liao west, but they could not extinguish us.  Reminding our subjects of their leaders' heritage would go a long way in legitimizing our rule."
 QRA_nation_of_vassals: "A Nation of Vassals"
 QRA_nation_of_vassals_desc: "At its height, our nation commanded the respect of numerous vassals, from the Kwarezmids in Persia to the Uighurs of Qocho in the Tarim Basin.  Unfortunately, many of our former subjects forgot where their loyalties should lie.  We should refine our administration so that future vassals understand that their prosperity depends on their loyalty to us."
 QRA_khitans_and_karluks: "Khitans and Karluks"
 QRA_khitans_and_karluks_desc: "While most of our population lives a sendentary lifestyle, our founders, the Khitans, remain a nomadic people.  The Karluks remain nomads as well, and our mutual lifestyles make us brothers in arms from horseback.  At the dawn of our nation, Yelü Dashi led tens of thousands of Khitans and Karluks to a great victory at Qatwan against the Kara-Khanids and their Seljuk overlords.  Encourging our nomadic peoples to remain ready to fight from horseback would go a long way in ensuring military supremacy on the Central Asian steppes."
 QRA_karakhanid_tax_collectors: "Kara-Khanid Tax Collectors"
 QRA_karakhanid_tax_collectors_desc: "Why slaughter or expel your former enemies when they could serve your administration?  After our successful early conquests, we allowed Kara-Khanids to remain in our empire as tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar.  Continuing this pragmatic approach with future conquests would ease administrative burdens and keep our government well funded from new subjects."
 QRA_salaried_soldiers: "Salaried Soldiers"
 QRA_salaried_soldiers_desc: "Who fights well on an empty stomach?  Unlike our neighbors, we pay our great warriors a salary for their service.  We should continue this practice to keep our soldiers well motivated and ready for battle."

 ltn_italian_ties: "Italian Ties"
 ltn_italian_ties_desc: "Although we are located in Greece, we mustn't forget the Sicilians who brought us to this position of power. Without help from Italy, Greece would still be a lot of squabbling crusader kingdoms paying tribute to the Serbian tsar."
 ltn_second_sack: "Second Sack of Constantinople"
 ltn_second_sack_desc: "Sacking it once wasn't enough. The Bulgarians, puppets to the Serbs, have proclaimed themselves the true Roman emperors, ignorant of the enemies surrounding them. Constantinople needs another lesson."

 JSL_three_jauhars: "The Three Jauhars"
 JSL_three_jauhars_desc: "Throughout our history, there have been three major jauhars that are a token of our harsh past.\nThe first of the jauhars was in 1294. After a harsh, extended 8 year siege on Jaisalmer Fort by Delhian armies led by Alauddin Khilji, 24,000 woman committed jauhar, or ritual suicide, to avoid being captured and sold as slaves or concubines.\nAfter a royal prince raided a Delhian camp and stole his prized steed, Firuz Shah Tugluq sought revenge and laid siege to Jaisalmer Fort. In this unforgettable moment, 16,000 women, the king, his prince, and 1,700 warriors lost their lives.\nThe most horrific of the jauhars was the last, which occured in the late 15th century. An Afghan chieftain by the name of Amir Ali took it upon himself to attack our Jaisalmer Fort and with no time to light the pyre, Rawal Lunakaran slaughtered the women in order to save them. Since there was no pyre, it is not referred to as a full jauhar, but instead a half one. Very tragically, however, was that the Rajputs had preemptively commited to this jauhar when they believed they were going to lose, and the Rajputs eventually won and Amir Ali was defeated and also died of a cannonball. We can not forget our grievous past and instead we must act in order to prevent this from ever occuring again."
 JSL_never_forget: "The Perilous Delhian Siege"
 JSL_never_forget_desc: "After a grand Bhati raid on a Delhian camp, Alauddin Khalji, provoked, brought an army and besieged Jaisalmer Fort. Our noble king then decided to send the elderly, sick, and children into a safe refuge in the desert in order to protect them as the warriors expected a fight to the death. For 8 and maybe even 9 long, treacherous years we stood our ground against the vile sultanate until they finally breached our walls and overrun the fort. Attempting to avoid capture, 24,000 woman died, whether it be by jauhar or voluntarily at the hands of their relatives. Most tragically of all, the remaining men walked out and accepted their death. After this, Jaisalmer was an abandoned, barren wasteland for years."
