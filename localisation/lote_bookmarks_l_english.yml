 LIGHT_OF_THE_EAST_EU:0 "The Fallout of Europe"
 LIGHT_OF_THE_EAST_EU_DESC:0 "The year is 1444, only a few short years after the devastating Plague of the Rapture. Much of Europe is still in recovery, and in countries such as France, up to three fourths of the nation were slaughtered by the disease. The few countries that were spared however are in a position of great opportunity: Norway had secured its union on Scotland almost a century ago, and continues to maintain a dominant position in Scandinavia, Poland still indirectly controls the Holy Roman Empire by maintaining the Piast dynasty in Bohemia, and the Cumans, mostly unrattled by the plague, are ready to re-establish their dominion over the steppes and defeat the Rus once and for all."
 JAMUKHA_KHAMAG_MONGOL_BM: "Rise of Jamukha"
 JAMUKHA_KHAMAG_MONGOL_BM_DESC: "The dawn of the 13th century saw the rise of Khan Jamukha in the Khamag Mongol, who sought to unify the Mongol people under one state. The other nations do not consider the Mongols to be threatening, and with Jamukha's leadership being average at best, it seems that there is good reason. The Mongols lack the leadership to make any real impact; something that Jamukha feels would be different in an alternate world."
