 LOTE_Mongolia.1.t: "Reforming the Mongol Tribes"
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.d: "For too long have the Mongols been a bunch of squabbling nomadic tribes. It is time to organize the Mongols into a single confederation, now that we control the land. But how shall we do it? Many Mongols still believe in a conservative way of life, and reform too radical could put our conquests in peril. We must make the right choice."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.a: "Make small changes to the existing system."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.b: "Adopt some elements of bureaucracy from surrounding nations."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.c: "If we are to be a regional power, we must completely reform our government!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.t: "Military Reforms of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.d: "The Mongol military is disorganized and suffers from incapable leadership as of now. Our monarch, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has prepared a solution to remedy this issue. The soldiers will be distributed into units called tumens, and leadership will be based on merit, not nobility. With a more organized military, what could stand in our way?"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.a: "All before the Khan!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.3.t: "The Great Border Raid"
 LOTE_Mongolia.3.d: "Our conquests have expanded all across Mongolia, and our desire for riches and land has grown even larger. Our options lie to the Turks in the west, or the Jin Chinese in all other directions. China is a land filled to the brim with treasures and valuable goods, so it is only natural for us to organize a great raid on their border provinces. Let us hope that this will demoralize them, ripening the land for future conquest!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.3.a: "Show them no mercy!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.4.t: "Mongols Raid Our Lands!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.4.d: "Our former tributaries in Mongolia have asserted their ambitions by raiding all of Northern China! This act of violence is something we cannot stand for, and the citizens whose lands have been looted and their goods stolen cry out for justice. The Mongols must be brought to justice - the burnt crops and murdered citizens will be avenged, and we must make sure the nomads never threaten us again!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.4.a: "This is an act of war!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.5.t: "Talent in the Family"
 LOTE_Mongolia.5.d: "Long have we awaited the day the clan of Barlas would have their place in the sun, and it seems that day has finally come. Of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s children, none seem to have learnt the ways of rule as quickly and efficiently as Timur. A paragon of talent, nobody in the Barlas clan can deny that he is going to shift the balance of power in Mongolia if he ascends. We ought make him the heir to the throne, there is no denying the good he will do for the Barlas clan."
 LOTE_Mongolia.5.a: "He will follow in Jamukha's footsteps."
 LOTE_Mongolia.6.t: "Mongolia United by Timur"
 LOTE_Mongolia.6.d: "The Mongol steppes have once again been united for the first time since Jamukha, by our very own Timur. Timur has ambitions far beyond Mongolia however, and seeks to leave his legacy upon the world by establishing a new dynasty named after himself. This would be abandoning the Barlas name, but Timur's influence cannot be understated. Should we usher in a new era of the Barlas people, or keep to the old dynasty?"
 LOTE_Mongolia.6.a: "The Barlas clan must not change - even in name."
 LOTE_Mongolia.6.b: "The Timurids will sweep across Eurasia!"
 
 LOTE_Spanish.1.t: "The Aftermath of Alarcos"
 LOTE_Spanish.1.d: "When the Castilian forces lost thirty thousand at the Battle of Alarcos just five years ago, all of Christendom knew its left flank was in grave danger. Indeed, the Almohad Caliphate has a clear path to retaking the former lands of Cordoba and establish al-Andalus once again. The Pope has taken notice of this and has called for a crusade against the Moroccan menace, but time is of the essence. Whatever the Almohads decide to do, we must be assured that God is on our side and against theirs."
 LOTE_Spanish.1.a: "Christus imperavit!"
 LOTE_Spanish.2.t: "Men of the Cross"
 LOTE_Spanish.2.d: "The call to arms for the entirety of Catholicism brings all faithful men to the cause. Be it knights with entourage and heavy cavalry or lowly peasants who wish to serve the Lord, all are welcome. To protect our region and repel the infidels from our borders, these men gladly throw themselves in the thick of the bloodiest battles in defense of their homelands, empowered and inspired by their faith."
 LOTE_Spanish.2.a: "These recruits are welcome."
 LOTE_Spanish.2.b: "A chance to serve a greater cause!"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.t: "The University of Salamanca"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.d: "Originally constructed as a Cathedral School, whose existence can be traced back to 1130, the university was founded in 1134 and recognized as a "General School of the Kingdom" by [Root.Ruler.Name] in [Current.Year]. The historical phrases "Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired. The principles of all sciences are taught in Salamanca!"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.a: "For science!"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.t: "The Fate of Leon"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.d: "The King of Leon is dead and in a petty attempt to secure the sovereignty and independence of his Kingdom, assigned [Leonese.Heir.Name] as his heir. Despite his best attempts however, the nobles of his realm have grown restless and disloyal to the royal child. In order to safeguard Iberia from Muslim threats, the region needs to be united under one house and one banner. Perhaps it's time to persuade our Leonese brethren to join us under our prestigious crown?"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.a: "It is time to reunite the house of Ivrea."
 LOTE_Spanish.4.b: "We would never degrade our name like that!"
 LOTE_Spanish.5.t: "The Code of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 LOTE_Spanish.5.d: "The presence of Jews in Iberia dates back hundreds of years. Known throughout the region as shrewd merchants and guardians of their host-countries, they have frequently been entrusted with the most vital aspects of administration during the various skirmishes between the Iberian Catholics and the Muslims. Having reclaimed vast swaths of land in our homeland, we must decide on the Jewish matter. Secular scholars of the council believe they would be a valuable addition in our administrative ranks while more conservative advisors believe that Jewish corruption would lead to breaking away from our Christian values. For the purpose of a decision in regards to the rights of Jews, [Get.Ruler.Name] decided to hold create the Codex of [Get.Capital.Name]."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.a: "Assign them guard posts of key cities."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.b: "Heed their advice on financial matters."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.c: "We have no need for heathens!"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.t: "The Royal Alhambra"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.d: "The Royal Palance of Alhambra (meaning "the Red One") is a royal residence and fortress complex located in Granada. Originally constructed as a small fortress during the late 9th century on the remains of Roman fortifications, it was then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls. Our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetName] has great plans for a major renovation of the entire complex into what will later be known as the greatest Muslim monument in Iberia."
 LOTE_Spanish.6.a: "A monument for all Muslims to gaze at in awe!"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.b: "Our resources are better used elsewhere."
 LOTE_Spanish.7.t: "Escuela de Traductores"
 LOTE_Spanish.7.d: "Traditionally Toledo was a center of multilingual culture and had prior importance as a center of learning and translation, beginning in its era under Muslim rule. Numerous classical works of ancient philosophers and scientists that had been translated into Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age "back east" were well known in Al-Andalus such as those from the Neoplatonism school, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Ptolemy, etc., as well as the works of ancient philosophers and scientists from Persia, India, and China. Founded in the late 12th century as the School of Translators, this unique establishment was the linguistic crossroads of Arabic, Castilian and Latin, serving as the gateway of Arabic works translated into Latin. Later, under King Alfonso X it would abandon its Latin translation and focuses solely at localizing Arabic work into Castilian, serving as the basis of the later-adopted Spanish language."
 LOTE_Spanish.7.a: "Fascinating!"
 LOTE_Spanish.8.t: "The Recapture of Toledo"
 LOTE_Spanish.8.d: "The tides of the war are slowly changing. What started as a great offense by the Iberian Christians has lost its momentum on the battlefield. That much is evident by the fact that Toledo, a key city in the region, is now back under our control. It is about time we kicked the infidel menace off our region and take back what is ours. An important center of trade, scholarly learning and a hub of minorities, Toledo will help revitalize and boost our financial and agricultural growth to never-before-seen heights!"
 LOTE_Spanish.8.a: "In Allah's name, the Christians will taste our blades!"
 LOTE_Spanish.8.b: "Forgive and forget, brother."
 LOTE_Spanish.9.t: "Reconquest of Valencia"
 LOTE_Spanish.9.d: "With all of Valencia reconquered from the Moors, the dominion of El Cid has returned to Catholicism once more. Now the question remains what to do with the territory. The people of Valencia have a strong sense of identity, and restoring El Cid's kingdom would surely win their approval along with that of fellow Catholics. However, one must consider the benefits of directly annexing it to the crown."
 LOTE_Spanish.9.a: "It would serve more use under direct control."
 LOTE_Spanish.9.b: "Let us restore the Kingdom of El Cid!"
 
 #crusades
 lote_crusades.1.t: "Preparations for the Crusade"
 lote_crusades.1.d: "It is almost time for the Fourth Crusade to be set in motion, we have the blessing of the Pope to lead it and the crusaders should arrive in Venice soon. Our humiliation at the hands of Saladin will be avenged, for he is no longer alive to contest us. We will strike at the heart of the Ayyubid Empire this time - Cairo, breaking their spirit and paving the way to the Holy Land. Christendom will prevail!"
 lote_crusades.1.a: "Deus Vult!"
 lote_crusades.2.t: "Obligations to the Pope"
 lote_crusades.2.d: "The Venetians have gathered the crusader forces in Venice, and ask us to honor our commitment to the crusade now. The Crusade is of great importance to Christendom, but there are issues at home to attend to as well. Should we send our troops to the Holy Land, it would leave us wide open to attack. We must consider whether or not to honor the call carefully."
 lote_crusades.2.a: "Eternal salvation is more important than mortal quarrels."
 lote_crusades.2.b: "We mustn't commit ourselves to something that would leave open our flank."
 lote_crusades.3.t: "The Crusaders Lack Funds"
 lote_crusades.3.d: "The crusaders have arrived, and in remarkably poor shape. They can barely afford their own armor and weapons, and beg the Doge to provide them with some sort of subsidies. This is not the kind of unpreparedness we had in mind, but we must adapt. The Doge's coffers are limited, but with a few loans we should be able to cover the funds. Alternatively, the Kingdom of Dalmatia is relatively isolated and en route to Cairo, the rich port city of Zara could provide all the loot we need..."
 lote_crusades.3.a: "The Doge will pay them off, even if it requires taking loans."
 lote_crusades.3.b: "To Zara it is, then."
 lote_crusades.4.t: "The Crusaders Attack Dalmatia"
 lote_crusades.4.d: "In an unprecidented move, Venice has taken a detour to loot Zara in order to fund the crusaders. This is not at all what the crusades are meant to accomplish, and it has stirred outrage in many nearby peoples, most notably the Hungarians. It is our choice to decide how to deal with this situation. Obviously it is an attack on their brothers in faith, but one could argue that the ends justify the means."
 lote_crusades.4.a: "We have no choice but to denounce them."
 lote_crusades.4.b: "Let it slide. Cairo will be their redemption."
 lote_crusades.5.t: "The Sack of Zara"
 lote_crusades.5.d: "Zara is in flames - the crusaders cut their way through the city sparing nobody, no men, women, or children. Zara has been devastated for years to come, but we have technically accomplished our goal. We have the money to continue the crusade with relative ease, and we should be on track to reach Cairo still in good time."
 lote_crusades.5.a: "It's all about the money."
 lote_crusades.6.t: "A Prince in Exile"
 lote_crusades.6.d: "Alexios IV, a Byzantine prince, has approached the Doge with a tantalizing offer. Men and riches for the crusading army in exchange for helping him onto the throne. The vast wealth of the Byzantine Empire would help immensely with taking Cairo, though some argue against it as it would take significant time away from our main goal. Still, Alexios promises a great reward, and the current emperor is unpopular enough for the coup to be relatively easy. It's almost too good to be true."
 lote_crusades.6.a: "Cairo can wait. We are taking a detour to Constantinople."
 lote_crusades.6.b: "It digresses too much from the main goal. Alexios will have another chance."
 lote_crusades.7.t: "Crusaders Support Alexios IV"
 lote_crusades.7.d: "It seems the pretender Alexios is craftier than we gave him credit for. He has enlisted the help of crusaders to make him the emperor of Rome. If Alexios III is an embarassment, then Alexios IV is a disaster waiting to happen. Still, the crusaders are a mighty force, and we may have no choice but to cave to their demands."
 lote_crusades.7.a: "The pretender may have the crown, so long as we can avoid conflict."
 lote_crusades.7.b: "What do the crusaders have against the might of Rome? Nothing!"
 lote_crusades.8.t: "Alexios' Promise"
 lote_crusades.8.d: "Alexios has promised the crusaders money and soldiers in exchange for putting him on the throne, and now the time has come for him to fulfill his end of the bargain. Unfortunately, he has overestimated the riches that Byzantium is capable of offering. To uphold our end of the deal would cost us decades of debt, not to mention the strain placed on the peasants from the taxes we will have to increase. But if we do not uphold the promise, who knows what the crusaders will do. Constantinople awaits Alexios' decision."
 lote_crusades.8.a: "We have no choice. Our coffers will have to suffer."
 lote_crusades.8.b: "We are more than ready for the crusaders' wrath."
 lote_crusades.9.t: "Alexios Fulfills his Obligations"
 lote_crusades.9.d: "It seems Byzantine diplomacy has been lost to old fashioned honesty today. Alexios has surprisingly provided us with what we need, men and cash for our crusade. Byzantium may be strained, but that is no longer our problem. We can focus on the real threat now - the Ayyubids in Cairo."
 lote_crusades.9.a: "To Cairo!"
 lote_crusades.10.t: "Alexios Betrays Us!"
 lote_crusades.10.d: "We are not surprised, but we are disappointed in Alexios' decision to refuse his end of the bargain. He has ordered the crusaders to leave Constantinople, which has sparked great outrage. Parts of the city were even destroyed by a fire started by angry crusaders. To simply abandon Byzantium would mean that all this time was spent on nothing, but we may have no choice. On the other hand, the Byzantines have committed an act of heresy by banishing good Catholics. Perhaps we could shift the crusade to them and end our main rival in trade once and for all."
 lote_crusades.10.a: "To war it is, then! The Romans will pay for their acts!"
 lote_crusades.10.b: "The crusaders must spare their wrath for Cairo. We have no business here anymore."
 lote_crusades.11.t: "Sack of Constantinople"
 lote_crusades.11.d: "The city was set ablaze, all of it burnt to ashes. By the time the crusaders were finished pillaging, hardly any Greek was alive to tell of it. Our crusaders have sacked Constantinople, taking every last bit of wealth the city had. We, too, have benefitted from it, our coffers benefitting nicely from the loot, though the act was barbaric. All of the Orthodox world remains horrified at this deed, and the likelihood of Rome surviving gets slimmer and slimmer. As Constantinople burns bright, we revel in the chaos."
 lote_crusades.11.a: "They got what was coming to them."
 lote_crusades.12.t: "A Change in Course"
 lote_crusades.12.d: "It seems the crusade has been shifted from Cairo to Constantinople. The Venetian envoy has explained that the Emperor has committed an act of treason, and therefore must be punished for his heresy. It may or may not be true, but nobody can deny the riches that are in store for us if we join. This is an opportunity to gain massive wealth and prestige, the Pope be damned!"
 lote_crusades.12.a: "The Crusade lives on! We will join the Venetians."
 lote_crusades.12.b: "It's not right, the Venetians are on their own."
 lote_ven_crusade_tt: "§YWe will be expected to join Venice when the crusade begins.§!"
 lote_alexios_in_debt_tt: "§YAlexios will be expected to uphold his end of the bargain.§!"
 lote_crusaders_will_capture_constantinople_tt: "§If Constantinople is occupied by the rebels, Alexios will be crowned as the Emperor!§!"

 #france 
 LOTE_FRA.1.t: "The Fate of Aquitaine"
 LOTE_FRA.1.d: "Aquitaine and Poitiers have remained independent polities for several decades now, but its very existence is at risk now that former duchess Eleanor is dead. Grievance must be followed by intense deliberation; Eleanor's love affairs saw Aquitaine heavily involved in both English and French politics, but many believe that Aquitaine deserves to go its own route."
 LOTE_FRA.1.a: "The English have treated Eleanor and our people well, it is time to tie the knot."
 LOTE_FRA.1.b: "Aquitaine is culturally French, and should be ruled from Paris."
 LOTE_FRA.1.c: "We have worked hard for our sovereignty and will not give it up so suddenly!"
 LOTE_FRA.2.t: "Arles and the Empire"
 LOTE_FRA.2.d: "The Kingdom of Arles has had a strange relationship with the Emperor ever since it was inducted into the Empire; it is ruled by the Emperor technically, but acts with high autonomy - as if it were independent itself. In truth, the only fruit of the Emperor being named the King of Arles is a more cordial relation. We ought to improve our standing with the Emperor on top what already exists. The best way would be to walk in the footsteps of Frederick Barbarossa, who was coronated in the city of Arles itself. If we establish Arles as the city from which new emperors are coronated, we would have much more prestige than before. Surely the Emperor can be persuaded to allow this!"
 LOTE_FRA.2.a: "Bribe the Emperor to make Arles the new city for coronation!"
 LOTE_FRA.2.b: "No, we must respect Aachen."
 LOTE_FRA.4.t: "A Request from Arles"
 LOTE_FRA.4.d: "The Kingdom of Arles has come to us with a very unusual request. In the style of the late Frederick Barbarossa, they propose that all emperors be coronated in Arles from now on. They have gathered together 200 ducats in hopes of persuading the Emperor. While this is an obvious grab for prestige, the ducats are tempting, and Arles is much more relevant to the Emperor than Aachen. Perhaps this is something worth considering."
 LOTE_FRA.4.a: "Why not? This seems like a harmless idea."
 LOTE_FRA.4.b: "And throw tradition out the window? Of course not!"
 LOTE_FRA.5.t: "The Emperor Accepts"
 LOTE_FRA.5.d: "The Emperor has decided to make coronation in the Arles the new tradition from now on. Now we will be the most splendorous nation in all of the Holy Roman Empire, and our relations with the Emperor will have never been better!"
 LOTE_FRA.5.a: "Success!"
 LOTE_FRA.6.t: "[From.GetName] Requests the Arelat Title"
 LOTE_FRA.6.d: "In a move of outstanding bravado, the monarch of [From.GetName] has sent envoys requesting that we grant him the inheritance of the Kingdom of Arles. The Emperor is concerned about what possible plans [From.GetSheHe] may be brewing, but the title is effectively meaningless at the moment. We could allow such a thing at the cost of some prestige, but this could be a part of a more elaborate scheme we will regret allowing later."
 LOTE_FRA.6.a: "It is a meaningless title. They can have it for all we care."
 LOTE_FRA.6.b: "Best not to get involved in this."
 LOTE_FRA.7.t: "The Emperor Accepts our Request"
 LOTE_FRA.7.d: "The Emperor has decided to grant us the title King of Arles on the condition that we still remain a Holy Roman prince. This is a crucial step towards restoring the once great kingdom, as it seems the Emperor is blissfully unaware of our true intentions. Under our leadership, the Arles will be restored greater than ever!"
 LOTE_FRA.7.a: "The first move has been made."
 lote_arles_tt: "§YArles will become the new city from which the Emperor is coronated, which means whomever owns Arles will receieve 25 prestige each time a new Emperor is elected.§!"
 
 #lombard
 LOTE_Lombard.1.t: "The Lombard League"
 LOTE_Lombard.1.d: "Weakness in the Empire has never been more apparent than now, with the secession of Northern Italy into a federation of cities called the Lombard League. It would be a blemish on the prestige of Aachen to allow this rebellion to go unpunished; we must rein the Italians in!"
 LOTE_Lombard.1.a: "We shall be swift and merciless."
 LOTE_Lombard.2.t: "The Lombard League"
 LOTE_Lombard.2.d: "In response to aggressive campaigns in Italy headed by the Holy Roman Emperor, we have become part of the Lombard League, a defensive alliance for the sole purpose of containing the Emperor's ambitions. However, the league has brought other benefits as well such as a common administration, exchange of ideas, an even a common identity. Only fate will tell what the future holds for the Lombard League."
 LOTE_Lombard.2.a: "For our sovereignty!"
 lombard_league_decisions_tt: "Decisions are unlocked for developing the Lombard League."
 
 #kiev
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.t: "Weakness in the Rus"
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.d: "Over the centuries, the Kievan Rus has been in sharp decline for a number of reasons, most notably the consolidation of power in its individual states. The members of the Rus are practically independent, and it is no secret that the other Russians want to relinquish our rule. These next few years will be the most trying time that Kiev has faced yet."
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.a: "Remain calm and steadfast."
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.tt: "Should the province of Kiev be occupied by a Russian prince at any point during the disaster, the disaster will end and all subjects will be released."
 
 #galicia volhynia
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.t: "The Capture of Kiev"
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.d: "The Kievan Rus has dominated the plains of Russia for centuries, but today marks a change in the continuum. Kiev has been overrun by Galician forces, and the city has been razed to the ground. It is clear to all the Rus that Kiev no longer has control over them!"
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.a: "A new era for Russia begins!"
 
 
 #denmark
 LOTE_DAN.1.t: "Absalon of Lund"
 LOTE_DAN.1.d: "A man of many talents and good friend of the king, Absalon, archbishop of Lund, has offered his services to the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Equally skilled in administration, diplomacy, and combat alike, he can fit into any role the king needs at the moment. Fiercely loyal to Denmark, he will be an invaluable asset to our king."
 LOTE_DAN.1.a: "He may oversee religious activity all across Denmark!"
 LOTE_DAN.1.b: "He would best fit the role of a statesman!"
 LOTE_DAN.1.c: "Absalon will lead our armies to victory!"
 
 #england
 LOTE_ENG.1.t: "The Magna Carta"
 LOTE_ENG.1.d: "The recent unrest caused by war against the French has caused the nobility of England to deem the king inefficient and incapable of rule on his own. They have devised a constitution to check the power of the king, forming a parliament that would ratify and approve of the king's actions before they are put into motion. This would strip away the absolute power of the king, but the nobility are keen on the idea. Risking a massive revolt if the king refuses, we may have no choice in the matter."
 LOTE_ENG.1.a: "Sign the Magna Carta."
 LOTE_ENG.1.b: "We will never abandon the power of the throne!"
 
 #pruthenia
 LOTE_PRT.1.t: "Reforming the Pruthenian Government?"
 LOTE_PRT.1.d: "With the unification of Pruthenia, many wonder if we are on the path to becoming similar to other polities in Europe. Indeed, unrest has been stirring about the legitimacy of this new union of Prussians. In order for Pruthenia to last, some long lasting choices will need to be made regarding the government. Maintaing the status quo will ensure stability for the Prussian people, but may put us in a backwards state compared to other European nations. Our advisors have devised an alternative - a clan council that is identical in all but name to the Oligarchic republics found elsewhere in Europe. Either way one goes about it, the government is a critical issue that must be addressed soon."
 LOTE_PRT.1.a: "We must modernize. The clan council sounds like the best idea."
 LOTE_PRT.1.b: "No need to stir the pot. Keep the old ways."
 LOTE_PRT.1.tt: "All provinces owned by us will lose 10 years of separatism and 5 unrest."
 
 #chola 
 LOTE_COA.1.t: "Decadence of the Chola Empire"
 LOTE_COA.1.d: "Under Rajendra Chola, our empire spanned from Telugu country to Sri Lanka to even Malaya itself, but enemy nations have carved up our territory piece by piece and we are left with a fraction of our former empire. Our leaders are weak, this is a fact nobody can deny. Now even our last foothold in Malaya is revolting; If Kedah manages to succeed in overthrowing Chola rule, it would confirm our dark age for everyone eyeing Chola territory. We must consolidate the realm and remove the inept leadership, before it is too late!"
 LOTE_COA.1.a: "We have no time to waste."
 LOTE_COA.1.tt: "§YIf the rebels hold Kedah for six months, we will lose the province as well as our cores in Malaya.§!"
 LOTE_COA.1.tt2: "§YThis modifier will be removed upon reconquering all cores in Malaya OR by having a ruler with three monarch points in each category.§!"
 LOTE_COA.2.t: "Loss of Malaya"
 LOTE_COA.2.d: "Our inability to protect from the insurgents has rendered it impossible to maintain our presence in Malaya. Already rival kingdoms are claiming what is left of our territory; it will not be long before our influence is erased entirely."
 LOTE_COA.2.a: "The empire has fallen from grace."
 LOTE_COA.3.t: "Unrest in Madurai"
 LOTE_COA.3.d: "The Pandyas of Madurai are a traditionally fiercely independent people, it is unatural for them to be subjugated by another power. Yet, at this moment in time, they are under our control. The king of the Pandya dynasty, however, is already rallying the people of Madurai to his cause of independence. It seems that we may have to make a show of force in the near future."
 LOTE_COA.3.a: "Troublesome."
 LOTE_COA.4.t: "Breaking the Chola Chains"
 LOTE_COA.4.d: "The time has come to break away from our oppressors, the Chola Empire! Weakened and lacking leadership, the Chola are no longer the great empire they used to be. We must break free from their control and establish a new status quo in Southern India!"
 LOTE_COA.4.a: "To arms!"
 LOTE_COA.4.b: "We are not in a good position to do so!"
 LOTE_COA.5.t: "The Pandyas Declare Independence"
 LOTE_COA.5.d: "It seems the unrest in Madurai has amounted to a declaration of independence from [MAD.Monarch.GetName.]. It is no surprise to us, but regardless we will have to deal with the consequences of letting ourselves fall into decadence. Let us hope for a swift and decisive victory."
 LOTE_COA.5.a: "The Pandyas will fall!"
 
 #japan
 LOTE_JAP.1.t: "Incompetence in the Shogunate"
 LOTE_JAP.1.d: "It is no surprise to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that [KMK.Monarch.GetName] is unable to fulfill his duty as Shogun. Pale and sickly, and unable to handle his own court, the situation in Japan grows dire with unrest as he remains unable to make a single decision on his own. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to form a regency council to rule over the Shogunate in place of the reigning Shogun. With him being so inept, it is unlikely that we will face much resistance."
 LOTE_JAP.1.a: "This plan will forward our ambitions, go through with it."
 LOTE_JAP.1.b: "There is a time and place for plotting, just not now."
 LOTE_JAP.2.t: "Regency Council Seizes Power"
 LOTE_JAP.2.d: "The conniving snake himself, [HJO.Monarch.GetName], has devised a council of elders to rule in place of our great Shogun! Such insolence would normally go severely punished, but with our Shogun being unable to handle his own nation, there has been no resistance! The Japanese clans seem eager to accept this power grab. If only we had better means to resist this!"
 LOTE_JAP.2.a: "There is nothing we can do at the moment. We must bide time."
 LOTE_JAP.3.t: "Ascendance of Sanetomo"
 LOTE_JAP.3.d: "Sanetomo, the appointed heir to the Shogunate, has ascended to his proper position. Now, our cards have been played, as he is loyal to the Hojo clan and only the Hojo clan. The other clans may be wary of us now, but who resist the Shikken, who controls the Shogunate itself? [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now in complete control of Kamakura, with the Shogun being reduced to a mere figurehead."
 LOTE_JAP.3.a: "Long live the Shikken!"
 LOTE_JAP.4.t: "The Plot Against Tokimasa"
 LOTE_JAP.4.d: "Tokimasa has arrogantly put himself in charge of the regency council he strongarmed into ruling in place of the Shogun. Now we are helpless against the whims of the Hojo regent. Shogun Yoriie has created a conspiracy to stop this dominance before it is too late with the goal of assassinating Tokimasa. We must act swiftly, or else the Shogun is doomed to be a powerless figurehead!"
 LOTE_JAP.4.a: "Execute the plot with haste!"
 LOTE_JAP.4.b: "We must wait for a better chance."
 LOTE_JAP.4.c: "Carefully execute the plot."
 LOTE_JAP.5.t: "The Plot Succeeds!"
 LOTE_JAP.5.d: "The plot against Tokimasa has successfully fulfilled its purpose - we are now back under the rule of Yoriie himself. There is no doubt that the Hojo clan will take great offense to this blow, but with the Shogun in control and with newfound legitimacy, they will be in no position to stop us."
 LOTE_JAP.5.a: "Good riddance."
 LOTE_JAP.6.t: "The Plot Fails!"
 LOTE_JAP.6.d: "The plot against Tokimasa has failed to see him assassinated. Word has spread that he is furious about Yoriie's scheming and seeks to retaliate harshly. It seems that Kamakura will have to wait longer to be free of Hojo influence."
 LOTE_JAP.6.a: "An unfortunate setback."
 LOTE_JAP.7.t: "Assassination of the Shikken"
 LOTE_JAP.7.d: "It seems that the regency was not the end of Kamakura's ambition. They have clung to their claim to the throne like cockroaches, and now have launched a plot against the Shikken himself. Unfortunately, the plot seems to have succeeded. The Shikken was found dead, and Yoriie is back on the throne in Kamakura. It seems that our ambitions have come to a screeching halt."
 LOTE_JAP.7.a: "A sad day for the Hojo clan."
 LOTE_JAP.8.t: "Yoriie's Plot Discovered"
 LOTE_JAP.8.d: "It seems that the regency was not the end of Kamakura's ambition. They have clung to their claim to the throne like cockroaches, and now have launched a plot against the Shikken himself. Fortunately, the plot has failed to result in anything. The Shikken is furious with Yoriie, and Yoriie ought to fear for his life. It seems that we are ever closer to ruling over Japan."
 LOTE_JAP.8.a: "They are all fools."
 LOTE_JAP.9.t: "The Hojo Retaliation"
 LOTE_JAP.9.d: "The Hojo executed Yoriie immediately after his plot was discovered, predictably. It is a sad turn of events, indeed, but there is nothing now we can do. At the moment, we are a mockery of a Shogunate, laughed at by the Shikken and other clans. We will have to work hard and bide time before we can restore our former glory."
 LOTE_JAP.9.a: "Our chance will come - wait patiently."
 LOTE_hojo_regency_tt: "Upon the ascension of Sanetomo, the Shikken of Hojo will be in control of Kamakura! If we are to avoid this, it would be wise to hire a spymaster advisor or build a large spy network in Hojo."

 LOTE_NOR.1.t: "Icelandic Fishers Rediscover Greenland"
 LOTE_NOR.1.d: "We have received news that, in the midst of searching for sources of cod, the old Norse colony of Greenland has been located once again. There are no reports of Norsemen still living there, but there is an abundance of cod. Surely allowing settlers to move there would boost our monopoly on fish during these times of famine - the only question is how involved the reigning monarch should be in the creation of these colonies."
 LOTE_NOR.1.a: "Personally fund the colonies, Greenland is a necessary source of food."
 LOTE_NOR.1.b: "Let the settlers come and go as they please."
