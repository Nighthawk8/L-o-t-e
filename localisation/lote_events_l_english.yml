 LOTE_Mongolia.1.t: "Reforming the Mongol Tribes"
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.d: "For too long have the Mongols been a bunch of squabbling nomadic tribes. It is time to organize the Mongols into a single confederation, now that we control the land. But how shall we do it? Many Mongols still believe in a conservative way of life, and reform too radical could put our conquests in peril. We must make the right choice."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.a: "Make small changes to the existing system."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.b: "Adopt some elements of bureaucracy from surrounding nations."
 LOTE_Mongolia.1.c: "If we are to be a regional power, we must completely reform our government!"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.t: "Military Reforms of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.d: "The Mongol military is disorganized and suffers from incapable leadership as of now. Our monarch, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has prepared a solution to remedy this issue. The soldiers will be distributed into units called tumens, and leadership will be based on merit, not nobility. With a more organized military, what could stand in our way?"
 LOTE_Mongolia.2.a: "All before the Khan!"

 LOTE_Spanish.1.t: "The Aftermath of Alarcos"
 LOTE_Spanish.1.d: "When the Castilian forces lost thirty thousand at the Battle of Alarcos just five years ago, all of Christendom knew its left flank was in grave danger. Indeed, the Almohad Caliphate has a clear path to retaking the former lands of Cordoba and establish al-Andalus once again. The Pope has taken notice of this and has called for a crusade against the Moroccan menace, but time is of the essence. Whatever the Almohads decide to do, we must be assured that God is on our side and against theirs."
 LOTE_Spanish.1.a: "Christus imperavit!"
 LOTE_Spanish.2.t: "Men of the Cross"
 LOTE_Spanish.2.d: "The call to arms for the entirety of Catholicism brings all faithful men to the cause. Be it knights with entourage and heavy cavalry or lowly peasants who wish to serve the Lord, all are welcome. To protect our region and repel the infidels from our borders, these men gladly throw themselves in the thick of the bloodiest battles in defense of their homelands, empowered and inspired by their faith."
 LOTE_Spanish.2.a: "These recruits are welcome."
 LOTE_Spanish.2.b: "A chance to serve a greater cause!"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.t: "The University of Salamanca"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.d: "Originally constructed as a Cathedral School, whose existence can be traced back to 1130, the university was founded in 1134 and recognized as a "General School of the Kingdom" by [Root.Ruler.Name] in [Current.Year]. The historical phrases "Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired. The principles of all sciences are taught in Salamanca!"
 LOTE_Spanish.3.a: "For science!"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.t: "The Fate of Leon"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.d: "The King of Leon is dead and in a petty attempt to secure the sovereignty and independence of his Kingdom, assigned [Leonese.Heir.Name] as his heir. Despite his best attempts however, the nobles of his realm have grown restless and disloyal to the royal child. In order to safeguard Iberia from Muslim threats, the region needs to be united under one house and one banner. Perhaps it's time to persuade our Leonese brethren to join us under our prestigious crown?"
 LOTE_Spanish.4.a: "It is time to reunite the house of Ivrea."
 LOTE_Spanish.4.b: "We would never degrade our name like that!"
 LOTE_Spanish.5.t: "The Code of [Root.Capital.GetName]
 LOTE_Spanish.5.d: "The presence of Jews in Iberia dates back hundreds of years. Known throughout the region as shrewd merchants and guardians of their host-countries, they have frequently been entrusted with the most vital aspects of administration during the various skirmishes between the Iberian Catholics and the Muslims. Having reclaimed vast swaths of land in our homeland, we must decide on the Jewish matter. Secular scholars of the council believe they would be a valuable addition in our administrative ranks while more conservative advisors believe that Jewish corruption would lead to breaking away from our Christian values. For the purpose of a decision in regards to the rights of Jews, [Get.Ruler.Name] decided to hold create the Codex of [Get.Capital.Name]."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.a: "Assign them guard posts of key cities."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.b: "Heed their advice on financial matters."
 LOTE_Spanish.5.c: "We have no need for heathens!"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.t: "The Royal Alhambra"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.d: "The Royal Palance of Alhambra (meaning "the Red One") is a royal residence and fortress complex located in Granada. Originally constructed as a small fortress during the late 9th century on the remains of Roman fortifications, it was then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls. Our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetName] has great plans for a major renovation of the entire complex into what will later be known as the greatest Muslim monument in Iberia."
 LOTE_Spanish.6.a: "A monument for all Muslims to gaze at in awe!"
 LOTE_Spanish.6.b: "Our resources are better used elsewhere."
 
 #crusades
 lote_crusades.1.t: "Reign of Alexios III"
 lote_crusades.1.d: "The history of the Angeloi dynasty has not been kind to us. Every Angeloi emperor has died to the hands of an assassin, with Alexios III being the latest to murder his way to the throne. With his cruel nature and aggressive diplomacy, Alexios only worsens the relations between Byzantium and the west. These are trying times for Rome, but if God wills it, Alexios will pull together the empire once again."
 lote_crusades.1.a: "We must remain calm in trying times."
 lote_crusades.2.t: "Preperations for the Crusade"
 lote_crusades.2.d: "Just a year ago, our Doge, Enrico Dandolo, answered the call of God and gold and assumed the position of leader for the Fourth Crusade. Now crusaders are arriving en masse in Venice, and it is finally time to organize the troops and head to Jerusalem. However, almost none of the knights have the ducats they will need to sustain themselves on the trip. Whether out of stupidity, blind fervor, or plain bad luck, we must decide what to do about this."
 lote_crusades.2.a: "We will pay for the crusaders - just as long as we get all the loot."
 lote_crusades.2.b: "The crusaders will be fed by zeal and rewarded with salvation in Heaven!"
 lote_crusades.3.t: "The Case of Prince Alexios"
 lote_crusades.3.d: "An outcast from the Byzantine Empire, Prince Alexios has been brought to the Doge's attention as he seeks to depose his uncle, also named Alexios, from the Byzantine throne. He has promised piles of gold, ten thousand men, and loyalty to the Pope in Rome in exchange for putting him on the throne. Although Byzantine thrones are forged of lies, we cannot pass up an opportunity to humiliate our rivals, but this may be a distraction from our main goals."
 lote_crusades.3.a: "A quick detour never hurt anybody."
 lote_crusades.3.b: "No. We must remain steadfast in our mission."
 lote_crusades.4.t: "Coronation of Alexios IV"
 lote_crusades.4.d: "The gates of Constantinople open to young Alexios, and he is met with boos, jeers, and rotten fruit. Even though he is hated by all Byzantines, the deed is done, and with Venice holding the empire effectively hostage, Byzantium has no choice but to crown him. Even just a week in, factions form in Constantinople for or against crusader influence. The situation is grim, even disregarding the extravagant promise Alexios made to the Venetian Doge."
 lote_crusades.4.a: "Byzantium has been humiliated!"
 lote_crusades.5.t: "Alexios's Promise"
 lote_crusades.5.d: "Now Alexios must uphold his end of the deal, even though he knew it was impossible from the beginning. The Doge waits impatiently for his gold, the crusaders for their reinforcements. This is a situation where Byzantine politics clearly don't work, so Alexios must make a choice: send the Venetians all they can, or take back what he promised. Both admit that Byzantium does not have enough to satisfy Enrico, and Alexios shivers knowing the disasterous outcome of either choice."
 lote_crusades.5.a: "We must uphold our end of the deal, even if it breaks us."
 lote_crusades.5.b: "We value our sovereignty above Venetian satisfaction."
 lote_crusades.6.t: "Alexios Keeps His Oath"
 lote_crusades.6.d: "To our surprise, the young King has brought us almost what we expected. Enough gold to get to Jerusalem, ten thousand men, and a letter proclaiming his servitude to the Pope. While this is surely devastating and humiliating to the Romans, this does ensure that we are still on track to finish the crusade."
 lote_crusades.6.a: "Onwards, to the Holy Land!"
 lote_crusades.7.t: "Alexios Breaks His Oath"
 lote_crusades.7.d: "In an unsurprising yet disappointing turn of events, Alexios has refused to bother with our reward. This is a classic example of Byzantine diplomacy, and the crusader knights quartered in Constantinople are overcome with desparate fury. It is clear that we stand a good chance of not making it to Jerusalem alive, so officially declaring the crusade against Byzantium is an option to be heavily considered."
 lote_crusades.7.a: "No good deed goes unpunished. We will exact a swift and bloody revenge."
 lote_crusades.7.b: "So be it."
 lote_crusades.8.t: "The Sack of Constantinople"
 lote_crusades.8.d: "Fire engulfs all sides of the city. No Greek man, woman, or child is spared in the massacre. And in the end, nothing of worth could be salvaged after the crusaders left. Constantinople has been utterly destroyed by the revenge driven crusaders, and now, the Venetians seek to dissolve Byzantium entirely. This may very well mark the beginning of the end for Rome."
 lote_crusades.8.a: "Horrific."
 lote_crusades.9.t: "Partitio Romaniae"
 lote_crusades.9.d: "The Byzantines have antagonized western Catholics for far too long, and so we took the fight to them and won. Constantinople has been burned to the ground, and the Greeks have now lost the will to fight. We will make sure our victory is absolute, and so the Doge has devised a system of Frankokratia to manage Greece in place of the Byzantines. These Catholic kingdoms will ensure that the schism never comes to prominence again, and that Catholicism remains the true interpretation of God's word."
 lote_crusades.9.a: "As it is written, so it shall be done."
 lote_crusades.10.t: "Mishandling of Crusade"
 lote_crusades.10.d: "Our usage of the crusaders to attack other Catholic nations has not gone by well with the Catholic community. The Pope in particular has taken great offense to this and has excommunicated the Venetian Doge. Many of the crusaders have deserted after finding out they were being used to promote our own interests instead of that of the Pope's."
 lote_crusades.10.a: "We should have known better."
 lote_crusades.11.t: "Capture of Constantinople"
 lote_crusades.11.d: "Our forces have finally managed to break through the Theodosian Walls and capture the city of Constantinople. Now Alexios IV can be coronated, and we will be rewarded greatly. Of course, there is the chance of Alexios breaking his end of the bargain. It is a very real possibility, but only time will tell what he chooses to do."
 lote_crusades.11.a: "And now we wait."
 lote_crusades_dont_do_it_tt: "If war is declared on another Catholic nation with the modifier applied, Venice will be excommunicated and the modifier weakened."
 lote_crusades_alexios_iv_tt: "Constantinople must be occupied to fulfill Alexios's claim."
 lote_crusades_break_byzzies_tt: "If we gain at least 95% war score, we can divide Byzantium into the Frankokratia."
 
 #france 
 LOTE_FRA.1.t: "The Fate of Aquitaine"
 LOTE_FRA.1.d: "Aquitaine and Poitiers have remained independent polities for several decades now, but its very existence is at risk now that former duchess Eleanor is dead. Grievance must be followed by intense deliberation; Eleanor's love affairs saw Aquitaine heavily involved in both English and French politics, but many believe that Aquitaine deserves to go its own route."
 LOTE_FRA.1.a: "The English have treated Eleanor and our people well, it is time to tie the knot."
 LOTE_FRA.1.b: "Aquitaine is culturally French, and should be ruled from Paris."
 LOTE_FRA.1.c: "We have worked hard for our sovereignty and will not give it up so suddenly!"
 
 #lombard
 LOTE_Lombard.1.t: "The Lombard League"
 LOTE_Lombard.1.d: "Weakness in the Empire has never been more apparent than now, with the secession of Northern Italy into a federation of cities called the Lombard League. It would be a blemish on the prestige of Aachen to allow this rebellion to go unpunished; we must rein the Italians in!"
 LOTE_Lombard.1.a: "We shall be swift and merciless."
 LOTE_Lombard.2.t: "The Lombard League"
 LOTE_Lombard.2.d: "In response to aggressive campaigns in Italy headed by the Holy Roman Emperor, we have become part of the Lombard League, a defensive alliance for the sole purpose of containing the Emperor's ambitions. However, the league has brought other benefits as well such as a common administration, exchange of ideas, an even a common identity. Only fate will tell what the future holds for the Lombard League."
 LOTE_Lombard.2.a: "For our sovereignty!"
 lombard_league_decisions_tt: "Decisions are unlocked for developing the Lombard League."
 
 #kiev
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.t: "Weakness in the Rus"
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.d: "Over the centuries, the Kievan Rus has been in sharp decline for a number of reasons, most notably the consolidation of power in its individual states. The members of the Rus are practically independent, and it is no secret that the other Russians want to relinquish our rule. These next few years will be the most trying time that Kiev has faced yet."
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.a: "Remain calm and steadfast."
 LOTE_KIE_events.1.tt: "Should the province of Kiev be occupied by a Russian prince at any point during the disaster, the disaster will end and all subjects will be released."
 
 #galicia volhynia
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.t: "The Capture of Kiev"
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.d: "The Kievan Rus has dominated the plains of Russia for centuries, but today marks a change in the continuum. Kiev has been overrun by Galician forces, and the city has been razed to the ground. It is clear to all the Rus that Kiev no longer has control over them!"
 LOTE_VOL_events.1.a: "A new era for Russia begins!"
 
 #disasters
 collapse_of_the_rus: "Collapse of the Rus"
 desc_collapse_of_the_rus: "The idea of a federation of Russian princes led by Kiev is rapidly falling apart as princes consolidate power and demand more autonomy."
