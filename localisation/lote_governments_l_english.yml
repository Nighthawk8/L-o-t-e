 pruthenian_high_council_desc: "We have successfully united the Pruthenian tribal kingdoms into one country, but the clans still refuse to give up their old ways of life. Surrounded by modern nations eyeing our land with great interest, it is imperative that we modernize our way of government in any way we can. We have devised a way to fool people into thinking that they are not giving up their ways of life while still modernizing our government into a republic similar to those in Europe. By electing a representative from each clan to form a high council responsible for managing Pruthenian affairs, the people can rest well knowing they are in good hands."

All kingdoms share the same amount of autonomy, including Aragon itself. This state of cooperation is unusual for Europe, but benefits us immensely by making our subjects much more useful to us."

However, such an expansive nation has its issues. The individual tribes are practically independent, with local chiefs reigning instead of being ruled directly from the throne. Although we are fearsome horse riders, our options of expansion are limited by the cooperation of the local chiefs."
