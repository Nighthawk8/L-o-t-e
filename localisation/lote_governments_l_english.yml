 pruthenian_high_council: "Pruthenian High Council"
 pruthenian_high_council_desc: "We have successfully united the Pruthenian tribal kingdoms into one country, but the clans still refuse to give up their old ways of life. Surrounded by modern nations eyeing our land with great interest, it is imperative that we modernize our way of government in any way we can. We have devised a way to fool people into thinking that they are not giving up their ways of life while still modernizing our government into a republic similar to those in Europe. By electing a representative from each clan to form a high council responsible for managing Pruthenian affairs, the people can rest well knowing they are in good hands."
 lote_composite_monarchy: "Composite Monarchy"
 lote_composite_monarchy_desc: "Our kingdom is made up of several kingdoms, in reality. The Crown of Aragon has successfully struck a balance between its many groups of people by allowing them to be ruled by local kings instead of directly from Aragon. All kingdoms share the same amount of autonomy, including Aragon itself. This state of cooperation is unusual for Europe, but benefits us immensely by making our subjects much more useful to us."
 cuman_kipchak_reform: "Cuman-Kipchak Confederation"
 cuman_kipchak_reform_desc: "The Cuman-Kipchak Confederation is an assortment of loosely confederated tribes spanning almost the entire Eurasian steppe. However, such an expansive nation has its issues. The individual tribes are practically independent, with local chiefs reigning instead of being ruled directly from the throne. Although we are fearsome horse riders, our options of expansion are limited by the cooperation of the local chiefs."
